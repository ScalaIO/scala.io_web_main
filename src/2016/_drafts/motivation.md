ScalaIO will be held in the end of October either 23-24,or 30-31 (depending on the last quite from the venues we have contacted.)

This is the second time ScalaIO will be held in Paris, last year  was some kind of rehearsal, we had about 40 speakers from around the world, one track fully in English, 250 people total and quite a few sponsors. Overall it was a success si we repeat th√© experience.

One of the thing we didn't manage as much as we wanted to last year was to open up the conference to non-scala talks.

Since the conference is called Scala.IO you can imagine that is it mostly about the Scala language. However it was always our objective to have a strong functional programming current to it and to invite other languages to show the Scala people how _they_ handle FP. There are always things to be inspired from or to learn from languages doing the same thing differently

This year I got the opportunity to get in touch with cellenza and jumped on it to get the word out to the F# community that we would love to get submissions of f# talks at this year's ScalaIO. We intend to have a dedicated track for functional programming which will not be all Scala. If we get enough quality submissions  we will discuss making a track specifically for other languages in which case. We will make sure the track is strategically place so it gets an audience.
We really want inspiration to go both ways.
