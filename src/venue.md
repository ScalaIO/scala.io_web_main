<h1>Scala.IO will be held in the CPE School in Lyon, France</h1>
<p>The venue, while less flashy than the last parisian venue is great for 300-500 people and perfectly equipped for conferences and hosts other international conferences.</p>
<p>Should you have the time, we recommend extending your stay in Lyon beyond the conference to enjoy the city. It is famous all over the world for it's gastronomy and quality of life. It is also a large UNESCO World Heritage Site including Roman vestiges and still used Renaissance building and passageways.</p>

<h2><em>Getting to CPE</em></h2>

<p><i class="fa fa-plane"></i> The Lyon Saint Exupery International airport is 30 minutes away from Lyon Part-Dieu using <a href="https://www.rhonexpress.fr/" alt="rhone express">Rhone-Express</a>.</p>
<p>Once at Lyon Part Dieu, switch to T4 heading for La DOUA - I.U.T Feyssine and stop at La Doua - Gaston Berger.</p>
<p>The T4 departs from the platform right next to the Rhone-Express stop.</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-train"></i> CPE is a few stops away from the Lyon Part-Dieu train station using tram T1 or tram T4, heading for La DOUA - I.U.T Feyssine and stop at La Doua - Gaston Berger. (10-15 minutes).</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-car"></i> Use the following address for your GPS :</p>
 <p>43 Boulevard du 11 Novembre 1918, 69100 Villeurbanne.</p>
 </p> There should be enough parking space around the school.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-bicycle"></i> For the healthiest of us, there are numerous bike rental stations around and there is one very close to the CPE School (Velo'v DOUA/ Avenue des arts).</p>
