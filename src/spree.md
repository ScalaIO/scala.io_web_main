title: Scala Center FLOSS Spree
---


# ScalaIO and the Scala Center join forces to set up a FLOSS Spree!

Always wanted to contribute to Free Libre Open Source Software but never knew where to start? We've got you covered!

On friday November 3rd afternoon, Julien Richard-Foy from the Scala Center will lead a four hours [Scala Center FLOSS Spree](https://github.com/scalacenter/sprees), where you will get to work on cool FLOSS Scala projects including [freestyle](https://github.com/frees-io/freestyle), [coursier](https://github.com/coursier/coursier), [scalafix](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix), [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) and many more. 

Prominent maintainers of each project will be there to help you help them. They'll have prepared a series of manageable issues, fixable in a few hours by people with no prior knowledge of the internal workings of their projects.

So come with us getting some PR submitted, and you'll go back with a rad Scala Contributor tee-shirt.

## It's time to give back to the community!

PS : If you're interested, please register to the [meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/suglyon/events/244079069/), that will help us know how much beverage, cookies, and, more importantly, T-shirts will be necessary.
