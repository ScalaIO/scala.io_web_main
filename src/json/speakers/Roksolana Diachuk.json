            "description": "We have many reasons to love functional programming. But have you thought that functional programming can be really close to the containers world?\r\nYou might have heard about Kubernetes, everyone's buzzing about it. Kubernetes may sound complex especially if youâ€™ve never worked with containers. A surprising thing is that you can actually apply your knowledge of functional programming to understand how Kubernetes works. If you want to know more about the bridge between these two worlds follow me on that path.\r\n",
