            "abstract": "Reduced complexity, enhanced productivity, robust programs. Such are the promises of Functional Programming. But is it automatic? Can we be sure that only by adopting a language like Scala our success is guaranteed?\nLet's revisit well known good practices, focusing on FP and in the Scala language.",
