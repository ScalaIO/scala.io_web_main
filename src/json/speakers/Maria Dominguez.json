            "description": "Scala is the prime language for distributed computing. Scala developers benefit from gaining expertise in BigData and Data Science frameworks, the goal of this session is to kick-start newcomers to these topics. \r\nThe workshop is structured in such a way that the different components of Spark are introduced and used to build a single complete data pipeline, from data collection to serving Machine learning models. We use historical and streaming cryptocurrency price data as a use case. The training covers the following topics:\r\n\r\n- Distributed computing and storage\r\n- Dataframes and Datasets for batch processing, data cleaning\r\n- Working with parquet files, importance of schemas\r\n- Simple ML: training and saving models, ML Pipelines\r\n- Streaming data, collectors and publishing to Kafka\r\n- Spark and Kafka integration\r\n- Predictions with ML models on a data stream\r\n",
            "abstract": "This hands-on session is a comprehensive introduction to Spark. Using interactive notebooks, attendees learn the concepts and APIs. Covered topics are batch processing with DataFrames, simple Machine Learning and processing a Kafka Stream, building from the ground a complete processing pipeline.",
