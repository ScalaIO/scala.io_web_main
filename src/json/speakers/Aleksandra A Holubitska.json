            "description": "Arrays are fast and donâ€™t box primitive values, but due to class tag requirements and mutability, they are painful to use and donâ€™t integrate well into functional code. In this presentation, Aleksandra A Holubitska introduces the audience to Chunk, a data type in ZIO thatâ€™s designed to be friendly to use, immutable, and high-performance. Learn more about how you can replace usage of arrays in your application with this new high-performance data type that powers ZIO Streams and other libraries in the ZIO ecosystem.",
