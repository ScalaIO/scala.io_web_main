            "description": "I started my career as a Java developer and after 7 years of Object Oriented development. 4 years ago,  I literally fell in love with the Functional Programming paradigm when I discovered Scala. Since, I work to figure out how to improve my skill in this subject. \r\n\r\nBut in parallel, I started having fun in the world of Creative Coding/Creative Technology.  And recently I had the opportunity to work on an interactive installation (Visual/Sound/Light) where I was in charge of the \"game\" development using the Game Engine Unity.\r\n\r\nThat was like discovering a new world, a mixture of excitement, disappointment, WTF, and OMG! \r\nThe goal of this talk is to share this journey and especially show how Functional programming start inspire Game Dev environment like Unity3D.",
