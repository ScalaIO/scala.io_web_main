Meaningful changes can be deeply buried and even with the correct commit in hand it is hard to see it in the proper context. I knew we can do better.\r\n\r\nI started by lifting history to token-level (‚Äúwho added this parameter to that method?‚Äù). Later, the time came for types and implicits and that was just the beginning. \r\n\r\nI will show how the basics of git, scalameta and semanticdb can be used to gather knowledge about code and a project‚Äôs history. I will show how to enhance this knowledge by providing information from code reviews and continuous integration. Finally, I will show how this information can be used within Review Buddy and how to configure and use it in your projects and IDEs.\r\n",
