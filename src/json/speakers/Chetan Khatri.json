Parallel read from JDBC: Challenges and best practices.\r\n\r\n4. Bulk Load API vs JDBC write\r\n\r\n5. An optimization strategy for Joins: SortMergeJoin vs BroadcastHashJoin\r\n\r\n6. Avoid unnecessary shuffle and use of coalesce, repartition, HashPartitioner with use cases. Impact on cache, Disk I/O, Leaking memory, Internal shuffle, spark executor, spark driver.\r\n\r\n7. What to do when spark default sort doesnâ€™t work!, Alternatives.\r\n\r\n8. Why dropDuplicates() doesnâ€™t result consistency, What is alternative.\r\n\r\n9. Optimize Spark stage generation plan: reduce unnecessary repetitive Actions.\r\n\r\n10. Predicate pushdown with partitioning and bucketing.\r\n\r\n11. Why not to use Scala Concurrent â€˜Futureâ€™ explicitly with Spark jobs.\r\n",
