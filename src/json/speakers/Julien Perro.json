Currently doing so at [Sqooba.io](https://sqooba.io).\r\n\r\nAnd to be totally open: I largely prefer spaces over tabs, but if you disagree I'd still be happy to see you at my talk :)",

            "description": "Did you ever have to combine multiple sources of time-series like data that were:\r\n\r\n  - misaligned\r\n  - had different sampling frequencies\r\n  - a lot of missing measures?\r\n\r\nThis kind of situations generated enough frustration for us to come up with an abstraction to hide all this under the rug:\r\n\r\nWe present a small library, [scala-timeseries-lib](https://github.com/Sqooba/scala-timeseries-lib), that abstracts the discreet and flaky nature of \r\ntime-series data away, looking instead at them as functions of time, which can be arbitrarily combined.\r\n\r\nMultiplying, summing, ... over your heterogeneous series is a breeze, while you can build series of any objects and define your own operators between them.\r\n\r\nIn essence, you can do:\r\n\r\n`val externalTemp: TimeSeries[Double] = ...` // load data from your favourite weather service\r\n\r\n`val internalTemp: TimeSeries[Double] = ...` // load data from your indoor sensor\r\n\r\n`val difference = internalTemp - externalTemp` // And very easily compute the difference.\r\n\r\n... and stop worrying about the details once and for all.",
