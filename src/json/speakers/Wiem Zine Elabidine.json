            "description": "Implementing responsive and high-performance applications is the most obvious challenge that we face in our programming life. \r\nItâ€™s interesting to deeply study concurrency and parallelism on the JVM. \r\nIn this talk you will learn how to describe parallel tasks and the idea behind Futures and the execution context.\r\nI will cover the tricky part of concurrency when the concurrent tasks share and use the same resources and how flying Futures in the same sky can make the moon sun at midnight! At the end I will talk about some possible solutions that you can use to reduce your worries about the pitfalls of concurrency.",
