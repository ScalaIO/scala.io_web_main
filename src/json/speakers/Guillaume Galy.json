I currently work for Fabernovel (formerly Zengularity), using technologies such as Scala, Play! or Akka to build modern, reactive applications that fit each of our clients' specific needs.",

            "description": "In this talk, I will start by giving a very short presentation of the Mill build tool: what does it do, where does it come from, what are its core design philosophies and main strengths?\r\n\r\nI will then proceed to a live-coding demo for most of the talk duration. It will be based on a simplified version of a personal project, https://github.com/guilgaly/cowsay4s; for the purpose of the demo I will focus mainly on writing the actual build definition while the code of the library itself will be mostly copy-pasted.\r\n\r\nDuring the demo, I will successively:\r\n\r\n- create a basic Mill project from scratch\r\n- cross-build for different Scala versions\r\n- cross-build for JVM/JS targets\r\n- write a custom build task (to do some simple code generation)\r\n- publish to a maven repository\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I will demonstrate some nice advantages of Mill, such as the ability to simply navigate through the build definition in an IDE or easily inspect JSON-formatted task results.",
            "abstract": "Confused by SBT? Here enters Li Haoyiâ€™s Mill, a build tool that human beings can actually understand! In this mostly live-coding session, weâ€™ll go from zero to cross-building a project for Scala.js and writing our own custom build tasks, getting you ready to give Mill a spin on your own projects.",
