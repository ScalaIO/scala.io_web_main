            "description": "In this talk we will learn about all new features that have been added in the akka framework to make actors type safe. Learn the difference between untyped and typed actors. Discover the API of Akka-Typed, typed actors' communication patterns, lifecycle and supervision etc.",
            "abstract": "Static typing is one of the many reasons you love coding in Scala but while mixing Akka actors with your scala code brings you down a bit as they accept Any and return Unit. Donâ€™t worry Akka-Typed is here to remedy that.",
