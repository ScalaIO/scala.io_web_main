      "description": "Have you ever heard the belief of functional programming being slow? Have you ever been caught by a `StackOverflowError` in your recursive functions? Have you ever rewritten your functional code into imperative style to make it fast and stack-safe? What if i told you how to write fast and stack-safe functional code? Even for non tail-recursive functions! ;)\r\n\r\nIn this talk i'll present you 10 tips to write fast and stack-safe functional code. It is based on my experience implementing [Auto-Batch](https://github.com/chrilves/auto-batch), a pure functional-programming Scala library to automatically batch API calls.\r\n\r\nThrough these 10 tips, we'll discuss many subjects together: what `@tailrec` really means and how to bypass it, how to make most functions tail-recursive, how to be sure your code is really stack-safe, which free data-structure to choose for your need, how to use smart constructors to speed things up, \"hidden\" features of the IO monads, applicatives vs monads, why parametricity is your friend, are Generalized Algebraic Data Types really useful (spoiler alert, they are!), is there a concrete use-case of continuation-passing style, ...",

      "description": "\r\n🇫🇷\r\nTL;DR: Tu aimes le type-system de Scala mais le trouve parfois complexe? Ce workshop est fait pour toi! Viens découvrir les types algébriques généralisés (GADT) par la pratique de nombreux use-cases: prédicats sur les types, raffinement de types, effets, dérivation d'implicits, ...\r\n\r\nLes langages fonctionnels sont souvent appréciés pour la facilité et fiabilité qu’ils offrent à définir et manipuler des structures de données au plus près du métier: `case class`, `sealed trait`, *pattern-matching* (`match-case`), etc... Quelques langages fonctionnels, dont Scala, vont encore plus loin en permettant:\r\n\r\n- d’exprimer des prédicats sur les types comme “le type T est supporté par la base de donnée” ou “les types A et B types sont égaux”.\r\n- de restreindre des fonctions ou `case class` à des familles de types comme “cette fonction est uniquement définie sur les types T supportés par la base de données”.\r\n- d’exprimer des effets algébriques comme “la base de données supporte telle et telle opérations”.\r\n- de dériver des implicits par des fonctions normales qui peuvent inspecter la structure du type concerné.\r\n- et même de la programmation au type-level.\r\nCes structures sont appelées types algébriques généralisés ou GADT.\r\n\r\nIls ont malheureusement la réputation d’être difficile à appréhender et peu utiles. Notre expérience nous a pourtant montré que les GADT offrent des solutions simples et performantes aux challenges cités plus haut. Ce workshop, contrairement aux présentations usuelles, se concentre sur ces usages pratiques. Il vise à faire naître l’intuition de l’auditoire par l’expérimentation dans ces situations du quotidien. Et par là même, leur offrir une trousse à outils concrète pour faire face à ces problématiques.\r\n\r\nCe workshop a été conçu pour s’adapter à un large éventail de participant·e·s, du/de la débutant·e, connaissant déjà `case classes`, `sealed trait` et *pattern-matching* mais n’ayant jamais entendu parler de GADT, aux expert·e·s Scala jouant au type-level.\r\nOn vous attend nombreux.\r\n\r\n🇬🇧\r\nTL;DR: You like the Scala type-system but find it complex sometimes? This workshop is made for you! Come discover Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADT) through practicing many use-cases: type predicates, type refinement, expressing effects, implicit derivation, type-level programming, …\r\n\r\nFunctional languages are appreciated due to the fact they are easy to use and their reliability to define and handle data structures close to the business: `case class`, `sealed trait`, *pattern-matching* (`match-case`), etc… Some of them, like Scala, go even further by:\r\n\r\n- Expressing predicates on types like “type T is supported by the database” or “types A et B are equals”\r\n- Restraining functions or `case class` to families of types like “this function is defined only on types T supported by the database”\r\n- Expressing algebraic effects like “the database supports only these operations”.\r\n- Deriving implicits with regular functions which can inspect the structure of the type.\r\n- Even type-level programming.\r\nThese structures are called Generalized Algebraic Data Types.\r\n\r\nThey are unfortunately reputed to be difficult to apprehend and not very useful. Our experience shows us you can come up with simple and effective solutions to the problems given above using GADT. This workshop, unlike usual presentations, will be focused on practical use cases. Its aim is to help the assistance develop their insight by practicing on these everyday situations and give them a practical toolkit to deal with these issues.\r\n\r\nThis workshop was designed to fit a large range of attendees, from the beginner, which already knows `case classes`, `sealed trait` et *pattern-matching* but has never heard about GADT, to the Scala type-level expert.\r\nWe are waiting for you.\r\n",

Metals is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation that enables users of these alternative text editors to enjoy rich IDE capabilities such as code completion, rename, diagnostics, goto definition and more. Metals is open source and available at https://github.com/scalameta/metals, where it is maintained by the Scala Center, VirtusLab along with contributors from the Scala community.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn how Metals builds on top of LSP to provide a productive code editing experience for Scala developers. You will see the newest features that Metals provides and how they can be used for your day-to-day coding. You will also see some cool new features from VS Code such as Life Share or Remote Development that thanks to Metals work out-of-the-box Scala.

And academia has lots of ideas!\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this talk is to go through 3 main testing methodologies, from the most common (and worst) to the most esoteric I know of. Along the way, we'll explain and formalise the issues we must solve when testing, and how to tackle them in different scenarios.\r\n\r\nWe intend to focus on two main methodologies:\r\n* property based testing, which is more and more accepted but also very often misused, and how to use it properly\r\n* metamorphic testing, which is basically unknown but very powerful for the scenarios in which it's applicable\r\n\r\nAt the end of the talk, attendants should have learned strategies to write property based tests that are easy to read and maintain, and far more useful then the usual strategy of _let's just rewrite the system under test_.  They should also a good idea of what metamorphic testing is and the knowledge required to start using it in their own code base straight away.\r\n\r\n[CAN BE GIVEN IN FRENCH]",

Why must we wait longer for a release of a library when only its docs are missing?\r\n\r\nDocumentation needs to evolve faster, and to continue improving even after the software it describes has stopped.

      "description": "Macros in Scala 3 are built on two well-known fundamental operations: quotation and splicing. Quotation converts program code to data, specifically, a (tree-like) representation of this code. It is expressed as `'{...}` for expressions and as `'[...]` for types. Splicing, expressed as `${ ... }`, goes the other way: it converts a program's representation to program code. With these operations we can build code-generators either at compile- or run-time. In this talk we will focus on the latter to effectively create a code-generator for two well-known libraries. Our goal will be to demonstrate how we can remove various abstractions that incur performance penalties through:\r\n\r\n- Partial evaluation (e.g., inlining) \r\n- Various forms of specialization (e.g., remove boxing) \r\n\r\nOur examples build on top of minispire, a small, self-contained kernel of Spire [presented by Denis Rosset](https://www.scaladays.org/schedule/pick-your-number-type-with-spire) and Shapeless 3 [presented by Miles Shabin](https://www.scaladays.org/schedule/the-shapeless-of-type-class-derivation-in-scala-3).\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "How do you tame the chaotic world of cryptocurrencies, with all that data that doesn't seem to make any sense? \r\n\r\nThe only possible answer is Reactive Systems and controlled streaming. Our goal is to find reliable patterns between events relative to a cryptocurrency (like a conference or a fork) and its relative price fluctuations. We need an always-on system that gathers this data from different sources, and we can't afford missing data because of downtimes. \r\n\r\nThis talk covers all the steps of a reactive data project. We start with domain modeling with DDD and Event-storming, then touch on the implementation side with a backpressured toolkit like Akka Streams, run our services on Google Cloud's Kubernetes and finally look at the data we gathered trying to find patterns.\r\nLambos have never been so close.\r\n",

Whether you’re a junior developer, a team lead, or an architect; you need to master the art of asking questions. Why is this skill so important? One study shows that curious children ask, on average, 73 questions every day, a practice that helps them learn faster. This practice is also true of students, interns, and new hires. Asking questions is the simplest and most productive way of learning.\n\nHowever, as we become more senior in our fields, we tend to assume we know it all and stop asking as many questions. But do we ever stop wondering, challenging ourselves, doubting things, or searching for answers?\n\nIn this keynote, Oli will share insights she's gained while conducting podcast interviews with individuals from a variety of sectors in the Scala community. She'll also discuss how she's incorporated these principles into asking the right questions, a skill that helps her be an effective technical consultant.",
