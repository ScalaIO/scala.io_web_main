<p>The first Scala.IO Conference will be held this year in Paris, October 24th-25th. Now is the time to submit speaking sessions and register to attend!</p>

<p>Scala.IO’s goal is to gather Scala and functional programming communities from all corners of the world to share their experiences and new ideas around creating applications, libraries and frameworks. Scala.IO provides a unique opportunity for developers to interact with the key actors of the language and related technologies.</p>

<p>The call for proposals will be open from July 7th to August 15th; however, we will announce accepted talks on a rolling basis, so get your proposals in quickly!</p>

<p>We are aiming to host a series of Workshops, Technical Talks, Reports of Real World Applications, Lightning Talk and Tools Demonstrations. The committee also looks for creative ideas from you, so submit any topic you think the community would find exciting, inspiring, thought provoking and interesting!</p>

<p>Depending on the proposal selection, we expect to have around 30-50% of the talks in English and the remaining talks in French. One track at least will be dedicated to English talks.</p>
