# Code of conduct

Scala.io is an all-ages event for people from many different backgrounds. We
expect presenters, exhibitors, and attendees to help make scala.io enjoyable
for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexuality, religious or ethnic
identity, or ability.

## All attendees

Please show respect for all attendees. In particular:

- Offensive behaviour such as verbal abuse, intimidation, or harrassment will
  not be tolerated.
- Remember that all our attendees are here for similar reasons, and do not
  make assumptions about anyone's interests, skill level, or profession based
  on their appearance or background.
- Remember that "no means no". If someone asks you to stop speaking about a
  particular subject, or to leave them alone, please do so.
- There are many parties associated with scala.io, and these guidelines apply
  equally there. Please consume alcohol responsibly.
- Support your friends and colleagues. If you see someone behaving badly,
  please let them know that you're not OK with it.

## Speakers

Please ensure that your presentation does not stigmatise, alienate, or marginalise any individual or group. In particular:

- Keep your slide deck G-rated.
- Anything beyond the occasional mild cuss word is not appropriate.
- While criticism of software, programming practices, etc, is OK, please try
  to offer constructive improvements or alternatives as part of your talk.
- Personal criticism and ad hominem attacks are never OK. 

## Exhibitors

Scala.io is an all-ages, mixed-gender event. Please make sure your booth and
party can be enjoyed by everyone. In particular, overtly sexualised booths or
parties, including "booth babes" or hired entertainers in provocative/sexy
attire, are not appropriate.
